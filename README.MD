# GQM+Strategies Phase 3 and 4 Front-End

## Initial Configuration
The web app needs Phase 3 and 4 back-ends to work correctly. See their own documentation for further
details. Once you have both back-ends working correctly, go to *main/resources/js/webapp_config.js* file
and change phase 3 and 4 endpoints.

## Hidden Business Logic
All pages in the web app are useful but not all of them are accessed directly.
See phase 3 and 4 documentation regarding MetaWorkflow tasks which contain
some logic on how to successfully create a strategic plan and measurement plan with 
relative validation operations.

## Improvements
The original web app was entirely written in JS using only jQuery with its
relative AJAX calls. We improved some parts of it adding AngularJS. We also
left the old files so you can see the differences. 

 Good Luck,
